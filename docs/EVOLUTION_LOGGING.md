# Evolution Logging — Recursive_Grimoire_ v1.13.0

## Overview

The Evolution Logging system provides persistent tracking of workflow iterations, recursive expansions, and module evolutions. It ensures traceability, reproducibility, and versioned history for **Recursive_Grimoire_** workflows.

---

## Logging Architecture

* **Source:** Logs are generated by `ai_memory.store`, `ai_recursive.expansion`, and `ai_core.workflow`
* **Format:** JSON and Markdown for human- and machine-readability
* **Storage:** `ai_memory/outputs/` for persistent logs, with version identifiers
* **Key Metadata:**

  * Workflow ID
  * Phase timestamps
  * Module changes
  * Recursive lineage references
  * Evaluation scores

---

## Traceability & Versioning

* Every recursive generation creates a new versioned record
* `lineage.py` maintains parent-child relationships between workflows
* Deterministic hashes ensure reproducibility of workflow outputs
* Changes are captured at both module and workflow levels

---

## Metrics Tracking

* Metrics captured via `metrics.py` include:

  * Clarity
  * Coverage
  * Expandability
  * Translatability
  * Execution duration
* Metrics are stored alongside workflow outputs for analysis and benchmarking
* Telemetry integration enables system-wide monitoring

---

## Logging API

### Store a Workflow Iteration

```python
from ai_memory.store import save_workflow
save_workflow(workflow_obj, version="v1.0.3")
```

### Retrieve Workflow Lineage

```python
from ai_memory.lineage import get_lineage
get_lineage(workflow_id="WF-20251130-001")
```

### Analyze Metrics

```python
from ai_memory.metrics import aggregate_metrics
aggregate_metrics(workflow_id="WF-20251130-001")
```

---

## Best Practices

* Log every recursive generation for reproducibility
* Maintain phase-level granularity for analysis
* Keep logs synchronized with evaluation scores
* Archive older versions for long-term traceability

---

## Onboarding Highlights

* Understand versioning and lineage tracking
* Leverage JSON logs for debugging and evaluation
* Ensure new modules integrate with logging and metrics pipelines
* Use telemetry for system monitoring and analysis
